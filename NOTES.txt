User Story: I can set up the board.
    In order to play the game as a player I can see the board

    nouns (objects): board, player
    verbs (functions/methods): play

    Expect Board to be an array
    Expect 


    Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.


    Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.


    Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.


    Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


User Story: When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.


    board
    randomGenerate, startGame

User Story: I can start and stop the board.

    board
    resume, pause

User Story: I can clear the board.

    board
    reset

User Story: When I press start, the game will play out.

    board
    start

User Story: Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.

const makeBoard = (width, height) => {

    push those copies into a row

Grid is a 3d array stored in state on the board component?

For each space in the array create a Cell instance and insert to the array? Or just a 1 or 0 in the array? 

Load up an intial random selection of live cells into state for first iteration via a createRandom type function in componentDidMount? 
Render the array to screen by mapping it to divs? or table? other?

On each iteration
   For each array element (whether live or dead) in the start array
       getNumberOfLiveNeighbours() = number of live neighbours (this seems a tricky task for above and below neighbours)
       Switch statement: If getNumberOfLiveNeighbours === x then turn on/off based on the 4 rules by setting 'alive' attribute key to true... or just setting the grid postion to 0 or 1 in a new array? Should it be a new array so that we don't compare cells to cells that have just been changed already.

       Re-render the view once all cells calculated and stored (store in a nextgen array and render that somehow?)
       The new generation becomes the starting generation for the next iteration.



Loop to generate next generation with an intervaltimer can then have a timer to stop the interval with clearinterval to pause?

If using a class, what is the benefit there? What does it give us? What are the properties and methods on the class that would be useful?




How do we hook that up to the actual view? How to render the array?



If a cell (whether on or off) has exactly 2 or 3 on cells in the 8 cells surrounding it, then that cell becomes (or remains) on.
       If an on cell has fewer than 2 cells surrounding it as described above, it becomes off.
       If an on cell has more than 3 cells surrounding it, it becomes off.
